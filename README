Simple AJAX library for PHP

AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML and is a meme coined by
the company Adaptive Path. The techniques used by AJAX work in all modern
browsers and involve a javascript HTTP request object and the ability to
manipulate the document object through javascript.

This package allows you to use AJAX techniques to make XML-RPC requests and
receive XML-RPC responses from javascript without causing a full page
request.

Function calls occur as follows:

1. Server renders javascript on client browser.
2. Client javascript calls function wrapper written in javascript.
3. Function wrapper sends an XML-RPC request via an XMLHttpRequest object
   to an XML-RPC server.
4. The XML-RPC server parses the request and sends the client an XML-RPC
   response.
5. Client javascript finishes receiving XML-RPC server response and parses
   the response into an appropriate javascrip object.

The client-side response parsing will create an appropriate variable type
automatically. This means arrays are returned as arrays and structs are
returned as objects.

There are several javascript objects being used:

1. The javascript required to make asynchronous XML-RPC client requests
   in various browsers.
2. The javascript required to parse and XML-RPC response
3. Utility XHTML javascript.
