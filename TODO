- make work with objects
+ make request type settable per function
  made it so the request_type is settable per object. This is the best way to
  do it.
- see about making some methods static
+ use SOAP XML for message passing instead of the weird string based concoction
  from Sajax.
  Using custom XML schema. SOAP is too much for what we need.
